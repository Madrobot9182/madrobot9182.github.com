    <p>
      As globalization continues to expand, the world we live in is currently
      struggling to keep up. Climate change ravages on, water levels are
      raising, and dangerous natural disasters are created. With about every
      country in the world signing the Paris agreement, the majority of them
      are not even close to the goals. The US is even leaving the agreement.
      Wealth inequality is now the highest it has ever been, with the top 1%
      holding 44% of the world's wealth. Large companies are exploiting free
      trade and lesser developed areas with cheap labor and relaxed
      regulations. Using their influence with the WTO to bypass local laws and
      regulations. Little is currently being done to combat climate change as
      forests are mowed down and our oceans are being filled with garbage.
      Countries and companies are instead of throwing the environment away in
      exchange for greater profits. The conclusion is that our current way of
      life cannot continue forever. Eventually, we will run out of resources,
      and when that happens it will bring the biggest crisis the modern world
      will ever see.

    <h3>
      What is our goal?
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">
      Our goal is to mitigate the negative impact of globalization while still
      deriving the benefits it brings to the people. These goals include:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Raising worker standards all around the world. This will be achieved
        once all the nations are visibly implementing and actively enforcing
        worker policies that follow the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combat Climate Change. Through the development of green alternatives
        and the discouragement of fossil fuel, our goal is for the world to
        meet the goal that the Paris agreement set in 2015. This is to reduce
        the temperature climb from 2°C to 1.5°C.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protect the environment. Protection from privatization and
        irreversible damages will allow sustainable prosperity. Reduce
        deforestation by 25% by 2030 and crackdown on illegal deforestation.
        Clean up the oceans, revive 10% of the coral reefs and remove all
        visible garbage off the beaches and shores.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure Transnational Corporations (TMC's) are contributing to
        sustainable prosperity. Our goal is to create an international
        standard for TMC's that promote environmental preservation and ethical
        practices. All TMC's operating outside their home country will have to
        abide by both the new standard and local laws where they operate in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compact wealth inequality. Help developing countries with raising
        minimum wages and developing infrastructure. The goal is to lower the
        poverty line, 10-30%, in ten years. Another goal is to encourage
        progressive tax systems so everyone pays their fair shares, a
        percentage of their total income.
      </li>
    </ol>

      The Proposal
    </h3>
    <div style="font-size:24px;padding:4px;min-height:450px">
      <ul style="margin-top:0p;font-size:24px">
        <li>
          Create a international workers committee that will help fund and enforce better
          worker standards around the world where it is lacking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Give out funds and incentives to groups working towards cleaning up
          the earth and counteracting global warming. Provide education,
          (advertisement, videos, presentations), to help educate people on the
          issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage countries to develop laws that promote sustainable
          prosperity for both corporations and the surrounding environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Require Transnational Corporations to follow an international standard
          inline to the Paris agreement limiting how many natural resources,
          (minerals, trees, the ocean), they can mine within a certain period.
          Simultaneously, force TMC's to follow regulations regarding how they
          can extract these resources in a more eco-friendly way.
        </li>
        <li>
          Give out funds and incentives to countries, particularly developing
          nations, to increase the development of basic infrastructure and raise
          the standard of living. Encourage countries to adopt a progressive tax
          system that taxes citizens fairly based on their wealth.

    <h3>
      How are we going to achieve this?
    </h3>
    <p>We plan to network with numerous organizations and any reputable charities
       who will help us achieve our goals. We hope to collaborate with the WTO in
       creating "fairer" free trade for all parties, by giving everyone a  voice 
       and equal amounts of power in the matter. Along with this mitigating the 
       negative impacts of economic globalization through preemptive action. We 
       would then like to team up with the UN itself to promote environmental 
       sustainability, using their influence to encourage more eco-friendly behavior.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What we face and what to expect
    </h3>
    <p>It's a guarantee that we will face resistance on our journey. The most likely 
       source will be transnational corporations that are currently benefiting from 
       the WTO and emits a lot of pollution. We plan to work with these companies to 
       find a middle ground everyone will be happy with. With slow, gradual progress, 
       this will allow the world to adapt at a reasonable pace. Once the action is in
       motion, it will also address the issue of getting people on our side. Momentum
       needs to build up, we give the first push.

    <h3>
      How we will change the world
    </h3>
    <p>When the world successfully fulfills this proposal, we will have succeeded in 
      promoting sustainable prosperity. While economic globalization may initially be 
      slowed down, better workers and a healthy environment will benefit everyone. Life 
      should not have a price tag. Reducing our consumption of natural resources will 
      allow for future sustainability, and ethical working standards will eliminate 
      exploitation through things like outsourcing and sweatshops. In all, the passing 
      of this proposal to the UN will be a win to humanity, for us and the future generations.
